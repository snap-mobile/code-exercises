/*
Accidents happen aboard Starships sometimes. In those particular cases,
we'll need to head to the nearest BattleStation to resupply. In this case,
we need to double up our crew. Since this is the future, we'll be cloning
our existing crew to make up for the unfilled spots.

1. Create a new array using the static method `cloneCrew`
2. Using the existing method on the Starship class, add the new clones to the crew.
3. Log out the starship's crew before and after cloning the current crew.
