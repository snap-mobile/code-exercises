/*
What we have here is a very bare-bones Typescript class. 
It contains a single property: 'name', but is missing the 
required constructor. 

1. Write a constructor for the CrewMember class.
2. Write a class method that will console.log the name of the CrewMember

class CrewMember {
  name: string;
